É só isso. Não tem mais jeito. Acabou. Boa sorte.

Não tenho o que dizer, são só palavras, e o que eu sinto... Não mudará.

Truth is, I never was blindsided. This breakup was long overdue.

Due to the natures of the last conficts, I've always been feeling that we were living a farce. That she was just cosplaying affection - whenever she could.

And then I began to view my relationship in 3rd person. Probably she did too.

I've kinda anticipated this moment. Just didn't really expect to be so abrupt. Like how the metal doors closed in front of me.

And actually, it was good that I made the question. To end the farce.

Because, at the end, none of us had it in us to go through another cycle, another dip. She fell out of love, and gave not so subtle hints of that. Hints that made me fell out of love as well. And took me out of a victim place, making me conscious of the deception and the farce - maybe hoping that we could actually go through.

We were simply victims of circumstance.
